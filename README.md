# Specialist in Python with FLASK towards DATA SCIENCE

Hello everyone, this repository contains a MENU DRIVEN PYTHON CODE that will take input from the user and based upon the Input entered, the program will execute the respective command

# Modules used for this project :-
1. os (To execute the commands)
2. getpass (For security purpose)
3. time (To give delays between interfaces)
4. pyttsx3 (To give audio as output)

# Pre-requisites to be fulfilled :-
Make sure that all the modules are available in your system. If you are using Anaconda to run the Python Interpreter, then you can confirm the installation of these modules from the following commands:-
1. *pip/conda install getpass*
2. *pip/conda install os*
3. *pip/conda install time*
4. *pip/conda install pyttsx3*

# How to use the code :-
1. First make sure you have *git* installed in your system. Confirm using :-
 *git --version*
 
2. Now, create an empty directory/folder in your system. You can do this either manually or can use the command :-
 *mkdir <location_where_you_want_to_create_the_folder>/<Folder_name>*
 
3. Open your CMD prompt, and go inside the folder by :- 
  *cd <full_location_of_your_created_folder>*
  
4. Use the command to clone the code :-
 *https://github.com/Prayag15-bit/SIP_task1.git*
 
5. Now, just use the python Interpreter to execute the program :-
 *python <file_name>.py*
 
# BOOM!! The code will start executing
